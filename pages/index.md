---Hi there, I'm EGOIST, that's probably a weird name, but it's taken from [a famous Japanese band](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoist_(band)>). You can call me Kevin if you prefer that way.

I'm 26 yo and a big fan of open source, I also love making tools to improve web development experience.

Currently I live in China but I plan to move overseas in the future. My biggest goal for now is to live a good life while working full time on open source. You can help me achieve this goal by [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/egoist).

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_egoistlily) and [GitHub](https://github.com/egoist). I'm also on [Telegram](https://t.me/kevinhazy), feel free to message me or [drop me an email](mailto:0x142857@gmail.com).
